# ArkanoidOrb2
A remake of a game I made in Flash when I was younger - Arkanoid Orb - which was in turn a remake of Uber Breakout II by Jiggmin.

(Maybe one day I'll upload the original, but I made it when I was 14 and it's not all that good)

## An animated gif demo

## Why?
Two reasons
- I want to learn Unity
- Arkanoid Orb was OK but there are some things I'd like to change about it. But Flash is obviously very out of fashion now, so I decided to remake in Unity instead.

## Where can I play this game?

### Update 27th August 2019

NEW FEATURE! You can now adjust the camera height using the up and down arrow keys. It doesn't affect gameplay but hey, it looks cool...
