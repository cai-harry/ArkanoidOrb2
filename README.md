# ArkanoidOrb2
A remake of a game I made in Flash when I was younger - Arkanoid Orb - which was in turn a remake of Uber Breakout II by Jiggmin.

## Why?
Two reasons
- I want to learn Unity
- Arkanoid Orb was OK but there are some things I'd like to change about it. But Flash is obviously very out of fashion now, so I decided to remake in Unity instead.

## Link to play
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE
The webgl version of this game is available to play [on my GitHub Portfolio](https://cai-harry.github.io/Portfolio/ArkanoidOrb2/index.html)
